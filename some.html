                <p> 
                    In the entrepreneurship competition, the task was to come up with a business idea based 
                    on four specific categories - we chose service innovation and developed a concept that
                    creates network and security.We also entered an online Idea Competition where we pitched for judges. 
                </p>


                <h3>
                    Work process:
                </h3>


                <p>
                    We filled in a BMC and mission template that helped describe the business idea and strategy.
                    A prototype of an app was developed in XD, that was used to test our audience to make sure it
                    matched our concept, mission and fictional future users.  
                </p>

                <h3>
                    What I learned:
                </h3>
    
                    <p>
                        My role was project management along with my co-pitcher. I ensured that all missions were
                        carried out and that order and structure were maintained. In addition, I pitched for the first time and
                        learned a lot about entrepreneurship and project management. I learned more in depth about prototypes,
                        usersegment and testing.

                Assignment:
            </h3>
            
                <p> 
                    In SoMe & Branding we worked with online marketing of our product from the entrepreneur competition,
                    and developed a sales platform. We created a prototype of a website (for mobile and desktop) that refers to
                    our prototype of an app created during the entrepreneur competition.
                </p>



            <h3>
                Work process:
            </h3>

                <p>
                    Since we already had a website to take as a starting point, the challenge was to make improvements in terms
                    of usability and appearance. In addition, it also had to be recoded into mobile-first function.
                </p>

            <h3>
                What I learned:
            </h3>

                <p>
                    My role was project manager, which meant that I again kept order and structure.
                    I was responsible for coding the front page, and making 2x content for our social media.
                    I gained a lot of new knowledge about social media and marketing. Including content creation,
                    content plans, branding, trends and tendencies etc. I also learned a lot of new stuff about HTML,
                    CSS and this time Javascript from Youtube. This was the first project we used GIT (-kraken), which
                    I also got better knowledge and understanding of.
