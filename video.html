        <h3>
            Assignment:
        </h3>

        <p> In this theme, the task was to make a self-selected “How-To” video
            that shows a process from A-Z. My group chose to make a video showing
            how to make a simple roasted veggie dish. We had a vision from the start
            of animated vegetables that came to life to add comedy and creativity.
        </p>



        <h3>
            Work process:
        </h3>

            <p>
                We worked with the whole process behind the production of videos.
                We prepared the script with scene descriptions, story boards and recorded
                voice-overs. Various animations were made for the video, and then we started the
                actual recording in one of our group members kitchen. We used two different cameras
                for wide- and longshots, and realized during the recording that we should have used
                extra lighting for certain scenes. In addition, it was limited how many could edit
                - we decided one was to edit on the big screen and the rest of us directed.
            </p>



            
            <h3>
                What I learned:
            </h3>

                <p>
                    My role was to ensure we got a script prepared with the accompanying scene description
                    and storyboards. Besides that, I also appeared as the actor. I gained a lot of new knowledge
                    about production in general. Better knowledge of sound, image composition and light, file formats
                    and editing as well as animations and the important concepts. I used a lot of Ai and Ps, and only
                    got a basic knowledge of Ae and Pr.
